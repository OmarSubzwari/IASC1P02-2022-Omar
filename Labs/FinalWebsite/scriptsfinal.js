//JS for this main page had to be done in the index.html file. I tried to incorporate it into this JS file however I was having some troubles. I reached out to TY and he mentioned that numbers cannot
//be included in strings. Therefore, I attempted everything I could to get it to work but eventually had to incorporate it into the .html file.
