<h1>Canada</h1>

			<h2>Etymology</h2>
			<p>While a variety of theories have been postulated for the etymological origins of Canada, the name is now accepted as coming from the St. Lawrence Iroquoian word kanata, meaning "village" or "settlement".[9] In 1535, indigenous inhabitants of the present-day Quebec City region used the word to direct French explorer Jacques Cartier to the village of Stadacona.[10] Cartier later used the word Canada to refer not only to that particular village, but the entire area subject to Donnacona (the chief at Stadacona);[10] by 1545, European books and maps had begun referring to this region as Canada.[10]

In the 17th and early 18th centuries, <strong>"Canada"</strong> referred to the part of New France that lay along the St. Lawrence River.[11] In 1791, the area became two British colonies called Upper Canada and Lower Canada collectively named The Canadas; until their union as the British Province of Canada in 1841.[12] Upon Confederation in 1867, Canada was adopted as the legal name for the new country, and the word Dominion was conferred as the country's title.[13] The transition away from the use of Dominion was formally reflected in 1982 with the passage of the Canada Act, which refers only to Canada. Later that year, the national holiday was renamed from Dominion Day to <strong>Canada Day</strong>.[14] The term "Dominion" is also used to distinguish the federal government from the provinces, though after the Second World War the term "federal" had replaced "dominion".[15]
