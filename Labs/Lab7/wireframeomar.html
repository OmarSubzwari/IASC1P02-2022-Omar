    <p>Descriptive Wireframe Document – Lab 7 Example
Use the following structure as a companion to your wireframe to describe all of its major components. Create and label as many items as you feel is appropriate for your wireframe. You should be able to hand your wireframe and this descriptive document over to another person and fully communicate your vision for your page.
Rationale: What are the major issues with the existing page and why have you chosen to modify them? Use the concepts we’ve learned so far such as Colour Theory, C.R.A.P. design theory, and Accessibility (font, alt tags, contrast, etc) to inform your rationale. Your rationale should be about 250 words.

Rationale:
The major issues I noted with the original website was too much colour on the webpage, not accessible due to the text issues in the image (text font, text style. Another font on the page was also hard to read. There was an attempt at a navigation bar however, it was hard to even tell it was a navigation bar, so this had to be updated right away. Not having a navigation bar can then further cause accessibility issues. The only means of distinction and emphasis used across the website are colour, underlining, and size. Additionally, it does not adhere to the recommended WCAG best practises for bolding, underlining, and logical order of information. The rough sketch I had done of the website design had the C.R.A.P design in mind while making the website and I think this is certainly a good basis to start on and follow through for a visually appealing and easy to navigate website. I decided to go with a three-block design for my redesign as it is a simple but very effective look to a website. It would be able to draw in a user due to the content in the three-block design and keep the visitor scrolling down the website page.
